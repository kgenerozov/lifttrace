/**
 * Keeps Trace's tool surface honest.
 *
 * Trace is a fourth caller alongside the app routes, the MCP tools and the
 * REST API, but it keeps its own tool list rather than importing the xCore
 * functions, so a feature can ship to the other three and silently miss it.
 * That is exactly what happened with progress photos. These guard the two
 * ways that drift shows up: a tool defined but never dispatched, and a tool
 * dispatched but never named in the system prompt (weaker models rely on
 * the prompt enumeration, not just the schema).
